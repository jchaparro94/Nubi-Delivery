# Nubi Delivery Services
### A web page inspired by a Udemy course that I completed.

## Overview
#### Nubi Delivery Service is a fast, luxury food delivery service. Specializing in quality food that is made minutes before it leaves for delivery. It gives our customers the options to set up and prep for their week. 

#### This was a practice page to further practice the listed languages and technologies listed below.

## Languages/Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap CSS
* Animate.CSS
* FontAwesome
* Bootstrap JS
* jQuery
* LightBox
* Owl Carousel
* Waypoints
* PHP Mailer


## Improvements
#### Future improvements would include uploading / connecting the website to an online server. As of now, the PHP Mailer is not connected and will not submit an email. I included within the 'Contact' folder all of the files and coding required for the contact form to work
#### Another future improvement would be implementing this same page but as a 5 page website. Setting up routes that would go to the different navigation links instead of a one page website.
